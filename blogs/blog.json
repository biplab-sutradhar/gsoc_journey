    "content": "Hey everyone! As part of my **GSoC 2025** project with animint2, I've been working on improving the testing infrastructure. One of the key tasks was migrating our tests from **RSelenium** to **Chromote**.\n\n**The Problem with RSelenium**\nRSelenium has been a staple for browser automation in R, but it comes with baggage. It's often **flaky**, requires a separate Selenium server, and can lead to silent failures especially in CI environments.\n\n**Why Chromote?**\nChromote is a lightweight R package that interfaces directly with headless Chrome via the DevTools protocol. It's **faster**, doesn't need external servers, and aligns with modern tools like shinytest2.\n\n**Migration Steps**\n• Inventory tests: examples/shiny, shiny-WorldBank, RMarkdown visualizations.\n• Create helpers **start_shiny_app()** and **start_rmd_app()**.\n• Use **callr** for background processes.\n• Integrate **ChromoteSession** for stability.\n• Fix CI workflow issues.\n\n**Results**\nThe suite now runs properly. Key lesson: reuse sessions and fixed ports for stability.\n\nCheck out the full PR: [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/animint/animint2/pull/209)\n\nWhat's your experience with R testing tools? Feel free to reach out!"
