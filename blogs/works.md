# Final GSoC 2025 Report 

## Introduction

Throughout the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025, I worked on the [animint2](https://github.com/animint/animint2) project, an R package for creating interactive, web-based visualizations. My contributions focused on improving layout flexibility, enhancing the [animint gallery](https://github.com/animint/gallery), migrating browser automation from RSelenium to chromote, and adding robust error handling. This report summarizes the key work I accomplished, including specific pull requests, issues addressed, and other deliverables.

## Key Contributions 

During the coding period, I made several enhancements, fixes, and additions to the animint2 package and its gallery. Here's a detailed overview of what I did:

** Layout Enhancements in theme_animint **
- Added three new attributes to `theme_animint`: `rowspan`, `colspan`, and `last_in_row`. These features enable flexible grid layouts for multiple plots. For example, `rowspan=2` allows a plot to span two rows, `colspan=2` spans two columns, and `last_in_row=TRUE` ensures proper closure of HTML table rows for clean rendering. This was implemented in [Pull Request #139](https://github.com/animint/animint2/pull/139) and further refined in [Pull Request #153](https://github.com/animint/animint2/pull/153), including updates to handle edge cases, complex combinations, and interactions with multi-plot tables.
- Improved rendering logic to support various rowspan and colspan combinations, making multi-plot setups more intuitive and robust.
- Added test cases for these new features to ensure stability and proper functionality.
- Refactored code to better handle specific visualizations like the World Bank plot, simplifying `current_tr` initialization for improved performance.

** Bug Fixes and Error Handling **
- Fixed a bug in `geom_raster()` that caused silent failures and disrupted plot renders. Added better error reporting to provide useful feedback to developers. This was resolved in [Pull Request #204](https://github.com/animint/animint2/pull/204), which was successfully merged.
- Addressed [Issue #213](https://github.com/animint/animint2/issues/213) by adding error messages for unrecognized geom parameters. Implemented the `validateShowSelectedParams` function (called in `getLayerParams`) and the `error_for_showSelected_variants` function to catch and prevent errors from invalid geom parameters. This was done in [Pull Request #215](https://github.com/animint/animint2/pull/215), which was merged.

** Migration from RSelenium to Chromote **
- Migrated RSelenium-based code to [chromote](https://github.com/rstudio/chromote) for more efficient browser automation, as part of addressing [Issue #143](https://github.com/animint/animint2/issues/143).
- Updated various test cases during the migration, cleaned up redundant functions to keep the codebase lean, and explored integrations with [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps.
- Added support for `tests_init()` and `tests_run()` in [Pull Request #209](https://github.com/animint/animint2/pull/209), including adjustments for better Shiny app integration and added Shiny test coverage.
- Handled challenges like edge cases and coverage issues (e.g., 'No valid coverage data was processed' error) during the process.

** Visualizations Added to the Animint Gallery **
- Ported and added several interactive visualizations to the [animint gallery](https://github.com/animint/gallery) to showcase capabilities and share with the community.
- Worked on `figure-candidates-interactive` to highlight selector-driven interactions, which was merged.
- Developed `Data-viz-with-506-selectors` (later refined as `Data-viz-with-206-selectors`) for high-dimensional filtering, and it was merged.
- Created `climate-change-sensor-stations` using real-world data with linked plots, submitted in [Pull Request #34](https://github.com/animint/gallery/pull/34) and [Pull Request #32](https://github.com/animint/gallery/pull/32), and successfully merged.
- Set up a solid structure for these visualizations to make future additions smoother.

** Other Work **
- Explored how `theme_animint()` uses HTML tables for plot layouts and how Shiny apps interact with animint2.
- Investigated and debugged issues, such as layout changes breaking the World Bank visualization.
- Published a blog post to guide new contributors on the process of contributing to the animint2 project: [Blog Post](https://biplab-sutradhar.github.io/gsoc_journey/blog.html?data=blogs/blog.md&type=blog-collection&post=2).
** Challenges and Learnings **
Throughout the project, I encountered challenges like debugging silent failures, handling edge cases in visualizations, navigating the RSelenium to chromote migration, and resolving test coverage issues. These experiences taught me a lot about R's declarative themes translating to HTML visualizations, the importance of robust error handling in layered systems, maintaining clean and efficient codebases, and using tools like chromote for testing. I also honed my problem-solving skills and gained a deeper understanding of interactive data visualization workflows.

## Conclusion 

My GSoC 2025 contributions have significantly enhanced the animint2 package's layout capabilities, improved its stability through bug fixes and migrations, and enriched the gallery with new interactive examples. These changes make the tool more user-friendly and reliable for creating dynamic visualizations. I'm grateful for the opportunity and excited about the project's future developments.
