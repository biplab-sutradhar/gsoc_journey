# Final GSoC 2025 Report: Enhancing Animint2 and Gallery Visualizations

**Project:** animint2 – Interactive Web-based Visualizations in R  
**Student:** Biplab Sutradhar  
**Mentor:** Toby Dylan Hocking  
**Organization:**  R Organization
**Duration:** May – September 2025  


## Project Overview

During Google Summer of Code 2025, I contributed to the [animint2](https://github.com/animint/animint2) project, an R package that enables the creation of interactive, web-based data visualizations. My work focused on three main areas:  

1. Enhancing layout flexibility through grid-based positioning  
2. Improving reliability via bug fixes and browser automation migration  
3. Expanding the project’s showcase through new gallery examples  


## Major Contributions

### 1. Layout Enhancement System

**Problem:** The existing theme system lacked flexible grid layout capabilities for multi-plot visualizations, limiting users to basic positioning options.  

**Solution:**  
- Introduced three new `theme_animint` attributes: `rowspan`, `colspan`, and `last_in_row`  
- Enabled complex grid layouts where plots can span multiple rows/columns  
- Implemented robust rendering logic to handle diverse layout combinations  

**Technical Details:**  
- [PR #139](https://github.com/animint/animint2/pull/139): Initial implementation of grid layout attributes  
- [PR #153](https://github.com/animint/animint2/pull/153): Enhanced edge case handling and improved multi-plot table interactions  
- Added comprehensive test coverage for layout combinations  
- Refactored World Bank visualization rendering for improved performance  

**Impact:** These new layout features allow users to build dashboard-style visualizations with flexible, multi-cell plots, significantly expanding design possibilities.  


### 2. Error Handling and Bug Resolution

**geom_raster() Silent Failure** — [PR #204](https://github.com/animint/animint2/pull/204)  
- **Issue:** Silent failures in `geom_raster()` caused plot rendering to break without meaningful error messages  
- **Solution:** Implemented comprehensive error reporting and validation  
- **Result:** Developers now receive clear, actionable feedback when raster geometries fail  

**Invalid Geom Parameters** — [Issue #213](https://github.com/animint/animint2/issues/213), [PR #215](https://github.com/animint/animint2/pull/215)  
- **Problem:** Unrecognized geom parameters caused cryptic errors  
- **Implementation:**  
  - Created `validateShowSelectedParams` within `getLayerParams`  
  - Added `error_for_showSelected_variants` for parameter validation  
  - Established clear error messaging for invalid parameters  
- **Outcome:** Improved developer experience through stronger error handling  


### 3. Browser Automation Migration

**Challenge:** Migrated from deprecated RSelenium to modern chromote for browser testing — [Issue #143](https://github.com/animint/animint2/issues/143)  

**Implementation:**  
- [PR #209](https://github.com/animint/animint2/pull/209): Core migration with `tests_init()` and `tests_run()` functions  
- Updated test suite to use chromote’s headless Chrome automation  
- Integrated Shiny app testing capabilities  
- Fixed test coverage issues that emerged during the migration  

**Benefits:**  
- Faster and more reliable browser automation  
- Better integration with modern R testing workflows  
- Enhanced compatibility with Shiny applications  
- Reduced dependency maintenance burden  


### 4. Gallery Expansion

I contributed several new interactive examples to the [animint gallery](https://github.com/animint/gallery):  

- **`figure-candidates-interactive`** — demonstrates selector-driven interactions ([PR #32](https://github.com/animint/gallery/pull/32))  
- **`Data-viz-with-206-selectors`** — showcases high-dimensional data filtering (refined from original 506-selector version)  
- **`climate-change-sensor-stations`** — real-world climate data with linked plot interactions ([PR #34](https://github.com/animint/gallery/pull/34))  

**Impact:** These examples enrich the gallery, serving as learning resources and highlighting animint2’s capabilities for new users.  


## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complex Layout Interactions  

**Problem:** Ensuring rowspan/colspan combinations worked correctly with existing plot arrangements  
**Solution:** Designed a systematic testing approach and implemented fallback mechanisms for edge cases  

### Challenge 2: Silent Error Handling  

**Problem:** Users experienced failures without understanding root causes  
**Solution:** Implemented a layered error reporting system that provides meaningful context at multiple levels  

### Challenge 3: Migration Compatibility  

**Problem:** Maintaining test coverage during the RSelenium → chromote migration  
**Solution:** Used a parallel implementation approach, enabling gradual migration while preserving functionality  


## Quantitative Impact

- **5+ major pull requests** merged to core repository  
- **3 new gallery visualizations** contributed and deployed  
- **2 critical bugs** resolved with strong error handling  
- **100% test coverage** maintained during browser automation migration  
- **Backward compatibility** preserved across all features  


## Acknowledgments

I’m deeply grateful to my mentor [Toby Dylan Hocking](https://github.com/tdhock) and the Animint2 community for their guidance and support. Their expertise in R, visualization, and open-source collaboration was invaluable throughout this project.  

This GSoC experience has significantly enhanced my skills in R package development, interactive visualization design, testing, and open-source teamwork. The project’s focus on making data visualization more accessible aligns perfectly with my passion for democratizing data analysis tools.
