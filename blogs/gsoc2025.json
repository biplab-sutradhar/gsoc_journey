        "Hey everyone, this week I dove right into improving the layout features in animint2. I opened [PR #139](https://github.com/animint/animint2/pull/139) where I added three new attributes to `theme_animint`: `rowspan`, `colspan`, and `last_in_row`. These make it way easier to create flexible grid layouts for multiple plots.",
        "For example, setting `rowspan=2` lets a plot take up two rows instead of the default one, `colspan=2` spans it across two columns, and `last_in_row=TRUE` makes sure the plot closes off the current row in the HTML table—super handy for clean rendering!",
        "I also tackled a tricky bug with `geom_raster()` that was causing silent failures and messing up plot renders. I raised [PR #204](https://github.com/animint/animint2/pull/204) to fix it, adding better error reporting so developers get useful feedback instead of crashes."
